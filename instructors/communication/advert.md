Introduction to Docker – 28-29 November

******* Infomercial theme plays *******

Have you ever heard these phrases when joining a project?

> "Oh you just need to..."
Do a very complicated set of steps to get the software to work!

> "It works on my machine!"
Are we shipping your machine?!

> "Sorry, can't reproduce that bug"
Oh… you use a Mac?

> "Ok so *in production* you need to..."
Use a completely different setup!

You can forget about all these troubles with Docker!
Enrol now on 0800-DOCKER!
Limited spaces available!

**************

On the 28th - 29th of November, 10:00 - 14:00, we will be running an Introduction to Docker course. It covers getting started with Docker and what it is, making and running containers and creating complete services with Docker Compose.

The course is fully interactive, so you should leave with all the skills you need to immediately start using Docker in your projects.

It is the first time the material will be taught, so we have been generous with timings and lunch will be provided.
