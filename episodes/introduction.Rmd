Welcome to the first lesson of Introduction to Docker!
In this lesson, we will teach you the fundamentals of Docker and how you can use it to make better software, faster.

But first, let's start with a collective release of tension.

# Joining a project is great, right?

Yes! But it can also be a nightmare.

Let's take a look at some problems you may have encountered when joining or starting a new project.

## "Oh you just need to ..."

Always a worrying phrase.
Software is complex and often depends on other software to work.

Manually installing dependencies can be a nightmare, even when you know what you're doing and there is documentation.
The situation gets worse if the documentation is poor or if _off piste_ dependencies are required!

## "Works on my machine"

You battled through it and you installed all the packages, so you're good to go, right?

Not necessarily. Different operating systems, different versions of software, different configurations can all lead to different results.

Asking for help might even get you the dreaded response... 'Well.. it works on my machine'.

## "Can't repro"

You're finally up and running. You've got all the packages installed and you're ready to go, correct versions and everything!

Surely nothing can stop you now?

Subtle differences in system configurations might not be immediately obvious, but can cause your software to behave differently.
This can lead to bugs that are difficult to reproduce and fix, frustrating you and your collaborators!

## "Ok so *in production* you need to ..."

Finally, you've got your machine set up **just right**. You can get on with your work!

But then... you need to deploy.

And low and behold, the production environment is different to your development environment, and you're back to square one.

# How can we make this better?

Enough problems! Let's talk about solutions.

There are a few ways to manage the process we attacked above better. One of the most popular is containerisation.

Containerisation is a technological answer to the common thought:
"I wish I could just send them my computer" / "I wish they could just send me their computer".

## What is a container?

A container can be though of as tiny virtual machine. It's a self-contained environment that has everything it needs to run a piece of software. This includes the software itself, the libraries it depends on, and the configuration it needs to run.

They are carefully isolated from the rest of the system, so they can't interfere or depend on other software on the host machine.

Containers can be run on any machine that has the container software installed, regardless of the operating system or configuration of the host machine. Meaning that the exact same environment can be run wherever you need it.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a tool that allows you to create and manage containers. It's one of the most popular containerisation tools and is widely used in industry and research.

It is also the subject of this workshop!

Without further ado, let's get started with Docker, making your life easier and your software better!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- Setting up software can be difficult and time consuming.
- Containers are self-contained environments that can run software more reliably.
- Docker allows you to make and run containers
