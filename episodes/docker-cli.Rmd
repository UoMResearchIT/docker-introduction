So! We’ve seen some pretty cool functionality from our Unicorn Counter straight out of the box. But really we need to take more control. 

While useful for learning, most Docker users eventually switch from Docker Desktop to the more powerful command line interface (CLI).

In this section we will build up a toolkit of Docker commands that allow us to perform the same tasks we learned to do in Docker Desktop, but with more control and flexibility. Building into more advanced Docker tasks that are only possible in the command line, in the next sections.

## Docker command cheat sheet

Before we dive in, here is a quick cheat sheet of the most common Docker commands.

Don't worry about understanding them yet, we will cover them in detail over the next few sections.

| Command                                | Description                                    |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `docker pull <image>`                  | Pull an image from a registry                  |
| `docker image ls`                      | List all images on the system                  |
| `docker inspect <image>`               | Show detailed information about an image       |
| `docker run <image>`                   | Run a container from an image                  |
| `docker ps`                            | List all running containers                    |
| `docker logs <container>`              | Show the logs of a container                   |
| `docker exec -it <container> <command>`| Run a command in a running container           |
| `docker stop <container>`              | Stop a running conta
iner                       |
| `docker start <container>`             | Start a stopped container                      |
| `docker stats`                         | Show live resource usage of containers         |
| `docker rm <container>`                | Remove a container                             |
| `docker image rm <image>`              | Remove an image                                |
| `docker system prune`                  | Remove all stopped containers and unused images|

## Building our Docker CLI Toolkit 

First things first - we need to cover some basics. What does thbe Docker CLI look like? What happens when we run commands?

Let’s dive in and start building our toolkit! 

### Pulling and Listing Images

To run an image, first we need to download it. In Docker, this is known as pulling an image.

Let’s start by pulling the SPUC container that we used before:

```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
latest: Pulling from uomresearchit/spuc
302e3ee49805: Already exists 
6b08635bc459: Pull complete 
18bb7c8edce2: Pull complete 
8341816e3d13: Pull complete 
5582a67fac1b: Pull complete 
0b0420cd5344: Pull complete 
0e3586f9748e: Pull complete 
d52edf8b814c: Pull complete 
eedd735a89e9: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:bc43ebfe7dbdbac5bc0b4d849dd2654206f4e4ed1fb87c827b91be56ce107f2e
Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
```

Now we have the image! But what how did that command work? The Docker CLI is a large and complex application but the syntaxt is quite predictable when you understand a few principles.

Let's dive into the structure of that command. Here is a diagram which breaks things down:

![](fig/docker_cmd.png){alt='A diagram showing the syntactic structure of a Docker command'}

Every Docker command starts with 'docker'. Next, you specify the type of object to act on, followed by the action to perform and the name of the object. You can also include additional arguments and switches as needed.

The pull command that we ran earlier is a good example of this. We told **Docker** to **pull** the image found at the location **'ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest'**.

Now that we have the image, let's check that it is there:

```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                                TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc                latest     f03fb04b8bc6   5 hours ago     137MB
```

This command lists (ls is short for list) all the images that we have downloaded. You should see the SPUC image listed here, along with some other information about it.

### Inspecting

It can be hard to guess what an image will do just from its name. To find out more about an image, we can use the inspect command

```
$ docker inspect ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
[
    {
        "Id": "sha256:f03fb04b8bc613f46cc1d1915d2f98dcb6e008ae8e212ae9a3dbfaa68c111476",
        "RepoTags": [
            "ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest"
        ],
        "RepoDigests": [
            "ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc@sha256:bc43ebfe7dbdbac5bc0b4d849dd2654206f4e4ed1fb87c827b91be56ce107f2e"
        ],
        "Parent": "",
        "Comment": "buildkit.dockerfile.v0",
        "Created": "2024-10-10T07:09:05.933695321+01:00",
        "DockerVersion": "",
        "Author": "",
        "Config": {
            "Hostname": "",
            "Domainname": "",
[...]
```

Tells you a **lot** of details about the image. This can be useful for understanding what the image does and how it is configured but can be overwhelming.

One particularly useful refinement of this command makes use of the `-f` flag to specify the output format. This can be used to extract specific information from the image and we will use it here to figure out exactly what the container will do when it is run.

```
$ docker inspect alpine -f "Entrypoint: {{.Config.Entrypoint}} Command: {{.Config.Cmd}}"
Entrypoint: [python /code/spuc.py] Command: [--units iuhc]
```

But what do these mean? The entrypoint is the base command for the container, while the command is the parameters for the base command. Together, they form the default command that the container will run when it is started.

In this case, the entrypoint is `python /code/spuc.py` and the command is `--units iuhc`. This means that when the container is run, it will execute the command `python /code/spuc.py --units iuhc`.

This is all we need to know to run the container, but we will come back to this later (and in more detail) when we discuss the lifecycle of a container.

### Running

Now that we have the image, and we know what it will do, let's run it!

```
$ docker run ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest

            \\
             \\
              \\
               \\
                >\/7
            _.-(6'  \
           (=___._/` \            ____  ____  _    _  ____
                )  \ |           / ___||  _ \| |  | |/ ___|
               /   / |           \___ \| |_) | |  | | |
              /    > /            ___) |  __/| |__| | |___
             j    < _\           |____/|_|    \____/ \____|
         _.-' :      ``.
         \ r=._\        `.       Space Purple Unicorn Counter
        <`\\_  \         .`-.
         \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
          \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
           \/         \|  \'  / `-._
                      ||    .'
                       \\  (
                        >\  >
                    ,.-' >.'
                   <.'_.''
                     <'
    
::::: Initializing SPUC...
::::: Units set to Imperial Unicorn Hoove Candles [iuhc].

Welcome to the Space Purple Unicorn Counter!
::::: Try 'curl -X PUT localhost:8321/unicorn_spotted?location=moon\&brightness=100' to record a unicorn sighting!
::::: Or 'curl localhost:8321/export' to download the unicorn sightings file!
```

And there we have it! The SPUC container is running and ready to count unicorns. Let's try out one of the commands that it suggests!

Only... it's quite hard to do this without another terminal window. Let's try running the container in the background instead, 'detached' from the terminal using the `-d` flag:

```
[Ctrl+C]
$ docker run -d ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
4d58ddad6ae33226ab30e8d7852b9b2166f214c462dabcecb65ef7a50518b0ec
```

But what is happening? We can't see the output of the container anymore! To see what is happening, we can use the `docker ps` command:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                  PORTS                                                                                                           NAMES
4d58ddad6ae3   ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest                  "python /code/spuc.p…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes                                                                                                                            peaceful_archimedes
```

This command lists all the containers that are currently running. You can see that the SPUC container is running, and that it has been (randomly) given the name `peaceful_archimedes`.

#### Exposing the service

Now that we know the container is running okay, we can try out the commands that it suggests:

```
curl -X PUT localhost:8321/unicorn_spotted?location=moon\&brightness=100
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8321 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server
```

Oh no! It looks like the container is not listening on the port that we expected. This is because the container is running in its own isolated environment, and we need to tell Docker to expose the port to the host machine.

This can be done using the `-p` flag, which specifies the port to expose on the host machine and the port to expose on the container. In this case we want to expose port 8321 on the host machine to port 8321 on the container:

```
$ docker run -d -p 8321:8321 ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
$ curl -X PUT localhost:8321/unicorn_spotted?location=moon\&brightness=100
{"message":"Unicorn sighting recorded!"}
```

Great! The container is now listening on port 8321, and we can interact with it using the `curl` command. But what if we want to see what is happening inside the container?

#### Logs

To see the output of the detached container, we can use the `docker logs` command:

```
$ docker logs peaceful_archimedes

            \\
             \\
              \\
               \\
                >\/7
            _.-(6'  \
           (=___._/` \            ____  ____  _    _  ____
                )  \ |           / ___||  _ \| |  | |/ ___|
               /   / |           \___ \| |_) | |  | | |
              /    > /            ___) |  __/| |__| | |___
             j    < _\           |____/|_|    \____/ \____|
         _.-' :      ``.
         \ r=._\        `.       Space Purple Unicorn Counter
        <`\\_  \         .`-.
         \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
          \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
           \/         \|  \'  / `-._
                      ||    .'
                       \\  (
                        >\  >
                    ,.-' >.'
                   <.'_.''
                     <'
    
::::: Initializing SPUC...
::::: Units set to Imperial Unicorn Hoove Candles [iuhc].

Welcome to the Space Purple Unicorn Counter!
::::: Try 'curl -X PUT localhost:8321/unicorn_spotted?location=moon\&brightness=100' to record a unicorn sighting!
::::: Or 'curl localhost:8321/export' to download the unicorn sightings file!

::::: (2024-10-10 16:05:35.263119) Unicorn spotted at moon!! Brightness: 100 iuhc
```

Now we can see the output of the container! Including the unicorn sighting that we just recorded.

Notice that we had to use the name of the container, `peaceful_archimedes`, to get the logs. This is because the `docker logs` command requires the name of the **container** not the **image**.

It can be quite inconvenient to have to find out the name of the container every time we want to see the logs. To make this easier, we can name the container when we run it using the `--name` flag:

```
$ docker run -d --name spucs_container -p 8321:8321 ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
4696d5301a792451f9954ba10cc42604a904fa1a811362733050ba04270c02eb
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint spucs_container (67e075648d16fafdf086573169d891bee9b33bec0c1cb5535cf82c715241bb32): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8321 failed: port is already allocated.
```

Oops! It looks like we already have a container running on port 8321. Of course, it is the container that we ran earlier, peaceful_archimedes, and we can't have two containers running on the same port!

To fix this, we can stop the container that is running on port 8321 using the `docker stop` command:

```
$ docker stop peaceful_archimedes
peaceful_archimedes
```

Right, now we can try running the container again:

```
$ docker run -d --name spucs_container -p 8321:8321 ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
bf9b2abc95a7c7f25dc8c1c4c334fcf4ce9642754ed7f6b5586d82f9e9e45ac7
```

And now we can see the logs using the name of the container, and even follow the logs in real time using the `-f` flag:

```
$ docker logs -f spucs_container
[... SPUCS OUTPUT ...]
[Crtl+C]
```

### Executing commands in a running container

But what if we want to run a command inside the container? We can do this using the `docker exec` command:

```
$  docker exec spucs_container ls output
unicorn_sightings.txt
```

This command runs the `ls` command inside the container, and lists the contents of the `output` directory. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting, or for running commands that are not available on the host machine.

If we want to interact with the container we can use the `-it` flag to run an interactive terminal session.

Let's try launching an interactive terminal session inside the container, running the bash shell:

```
$ docker exec -it spucs_container /bin/bash
root@bf9b2abc95a7:/code# cat output/unicorn_sightings.txt 
time,brightness,unit
2024-10-10 16:15:58.284557,100,iuhc
```

This command starts an interactive terminal session inside the container, and we can now run commands as if we were inside the container itself. In this case we are using the `/bin/bash` command to start a bash shell.

### Reviving

It is probably a good idea to stop the container when we are done with it. We can do this using the `docker stop` command:

```
$ docker stop spucs_container
spucs_container
```

But what if we wanted to restart a container that we had stopped? We can do this using the `docker start` command:

```
$ docker start spucs_container
spucs_container
```

We could check that the container is running again using the `docker ps` command, however, we can also use the `docker stats` command to see the live resource usage of the container (similar to the task manager on Windows or top on Linux):

```
$ docker stats
CONTAINER ID   NAME                          CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O           BLOCK I/O        PIDS
bf9b2abc95a7   spucs_container               0.01%     23.61MiB / 15.29GiB   0.15%     23.6kB / 589B     5.1MB / 201kB    5
[Crtl+C]
```

### Cleaning up

The last thing we need to know is how to clean up after ourselves. We can do this using the `docker rm` command to remove a container, and the `docker image rm` command to remove an image:

```
$ docker stop spucs_container # will take ~10 seconds!
spucs_container
$ docker rm spucs_container
spucs_container
$ docker image rm ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
Untagged: ghcr.io/uomresearchit/spuc:latest
Deleted: sha256:a1bc13eca67e7c1e8e1f506f2352e3621ce6c648b0d77ce7cbb095a95da6d5da
```

To do a full clean up, we can also remove all stopped containers and unused images using the `docker system prune` command:

```
$ docker system prune
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - unused build cache

### Summary

We have now covered the basics of the Docker CLI, building up a powerfull toolkit of commands!

We are now equipped with everything we saw we could do in Docker Desktop, but with the added power of the command line interface. Which we will use for move advanced tasks in the next sections.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- The Docker CLI can perform all the tasks that Docker Desktop can (and more - coming up!)
- The Docker CLI is structured around a base command, a specialising command, an action command, and the name of the object to act on
- With a few core commands, and a cheatsheet, we can build a powerful toolkit for working with Docker containers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::







So far, we have seen how easily you can find images and run containers in Docker Desktop.
However, we have also seen Docker Desktop's limitations, why couldn't we do anything useful with our Alpine container?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
- Learn the lifecycle of Docker containers
- Learn how to use the Docker command line to perform tasks we learned to do in Docker Desktop
- Learn to perform more advanced Docker tasks, only possible in the command line
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions
- What actually happens when I run a container?
- How can I control the behaviour of containers?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To understand this, we need to learn about the lifecycle of Docker containers.


## Container lifecycle

So, what happens when we run a Docker container?
![](fig/docker_life_0.png){alt='A flowchart showing the lifecycle of a Docker container.'}


### Startup

When we run a Docker container, the first set of actions occur during the "startup" phase:

- First, Docker checks if you already have the container image, and downloads it if you don't (known as a pull)
- Next, the container image is used to create the container and start the container's runtime environment


### Default Command

Once the container has started, it executes its default command.

The default command is specified by the image's creator and is formed of two parts:

- Entrypoint: The base command for the container (may be omitted, default: "")
- Command: Parameters for the base command (or, if entrypoint omitted, the whole default command)

When the container runs, Entrypoint and Command are concatenated to form the default command which is then executed.


### Shutdown

Whether a container shuts down depends on the default command. A container will not shutdown until its default process has finished.

Therefore, a command the runs to completion will allow a container to shut down, but a service that runs indefinitely will not.


### Examples

Let's take a look at some examples.


#### Example 1

![](fig/docker_life_1.png){alt='A flowchart showing the lifecycle of a Docker container. with an example'}

In example 1, an Entrypoint of "echo" is given along with a Command of "hello world" to the container.

This works in exactly the same way as running the following in a standard terminal:

```
$ echo hello world
```


#### Example 2

![](fig/docker_life_2.png){alt='A flowchart showing the lifecycle of a Docker container. with an example'}

In example 2, an Entrypoint of "sleep" is given along with a Command of "infinity" to the container.

This causes the container to run the sleep command indefinitely,
meaning that the default command never finishes, and the container stays alive without shutting down.

This example may seem artificial, but it is common to have containers that run indefinitely.
A common example would be a webserver which renders a website, running until stopped or changed.


## Return to Alpine

So, how does this explain why the Alpine container seemed so uninteresting?

First, let's apply what we have learned about the lifecycle of a Docker container.
Let's find out what the Entrypoint and Command for the Alpine container are.
To do this we will use the Docker command line interface.


### Docker command line syntax

The general syntax for the Docker command line explained in this diagram:

![](fig/docker_cmd.png){alt='A diagram showing the syntactic structure of a Docker command'}

There is a base command, always "docker".
A specialising command which specifies the type of the object you wish to act on.
The action command which select the actual process that will beformed and finally the name of the object you wish to act on.
You may also need to add extra arguments and switches.


### Inspecting images

Applying this, we want to **inspect** the **image** of **Alpine** to find out the Entrypoint and Command.
We can do this by running the command below,
where we have specified an extra argument `-f` which is a string specifying the output format of the command
(without it we would get a large JSON dump describing the container).
```bash
docker inspect alpine -f "Entrypoint: {{.Config.Entrypoint}} Command: {{.Config.Cmd}}"
```
```output
Entrypoint: [] Command: [/bin/sh]
```

So, we can see from this command that Alpine specifies:

- Entrypoint: null (unspecified)
- Command: /bin/sh

Therefore, the default command for Alpine is: "/bin/sh".

What is wrong with this? Shouldn't this just open a terminal prompt?

Not in this case! Running a command in a Docker container is not quite like running it in your terminal.

When you use your terminal, you are able to type commands and interact with the underlying system.
By default however, Docker does not allow containers to do this.
Without special measures, a Docker container has no way of recieving interactions and instead sends a empty signal to the sh process.
sh is programmed to exit when it recieves an empty signal and therefore finishes its process.
```
$ /bin/sh               # you might expect Docker to be running the default command like this
$ /bin/sh \< /dev/null  # but actually, it is like this!
```

This is why the Alpine contatainer seemed so uninteresting, in Docker Desktop there was no way for us to provide an interactive session to the container!
It is possible to change this behavior, but not using Docker Desktop.
Instead, we now need to dig in to the more powerful and flexible Docker Command Line Interface.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
###
This behavior can also be seen on other shell-like containers, for example those with "bash" or "python" as default commands.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Running a container

So, how does the Docker command line address this? Can we use the Docker CLI to interact with our containers?

Let's now focus on running Docker containers using the CLI.

Again, we will use the docker base command, this time specialising this command with 'run' and the name of an image;
to tell Docker that we want to start up the specified container image.
```bash
$ docker run alpine
```

You will likely see output similar to the below:
```output
> \##Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
> latest: Pulling from library/alpine
> f56be85fc22e: Already exists
> Digest: sha256:124c7d2707904eea7431fffe91522a01e5a861a624ee31d03372cc1d138a3126
> Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
```

This output shows docker recognising that it does not have the Alpine image locally,
and beginning the process of downloading and storing the image.

But is something missing? We don't see any other output? Let's run the command again.
```bash
$ docker run alpine
```
```output
>
```

This time there is no output at all, with the image already downloaded it is able to run without downloading.
But why is no output produced?
This is for the same reason as when we tried running Alpine in Docker Desktop (as explained above),
the Docker run command is not sending any commands, and the default command exits automatically.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
### Downloading containers
When we run docker run, the image we ask for is automatically downloaded.
If you wanted to download in image without running this is also possible. You can use:
```bash
$ docker pull alpine
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Why don't we finally try and make Alpine do something?


## Overriding the default command

To get the Alpine image to do something interesting; we will want to overwrite the default command.

This can be done in the Docker CLI, by specifying the desired command, after the docker run command and image name.

For example, if we wanted the Alpine container to print "hello world", we could use the standard Unix command, echo.
```bash
$ docker run alpine echo "hello world"
```
```output
> hello world
```

Great! We have finally managed to do something interesting with the Alpine image.

This is a big step, but how can we evolve from here? What if we tried to generalise our printing command?

We can do this by modifying the entrypoint portion of the default command 
(remember: the entrypoint is the portion of the default command which prefixes the command that comes after the image name).

This way we can have just the text we want to print after the image name.

We do this by adding the '--entrypoint' switch to our Docker command, followed by the command we want to become the entrypoint.
```bash
$ docker run --entrypoint echo alpine "hello world"
$ docker run --entrypoint echo alpine "lovely day"
```
```output
> hello world
> lovely day
```

Wonderful! But this needn't be limited to just echo, let's use this approach to get some more information about the container,
by printing the contents of a special file called 'os-release'.
```bash
$ docker run alpine cat /etc/os-release
```
```output
NAME="Alpine Linux"
ID=alpine
VERSION\_ID=3.17.3
PRETTY\_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.17"
HOME\_URL="[https://alpinelinux.org/](https://alpinelinux.org/)"
BUG\_REPORT\_URL="[https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues)"
```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
### Make the container use cat as a base command
Can you make the Alpine container use cat as its base command? Can you print the os-release information using this approach?

::::::::::::::::::::::: solution
```bash
$ docker run --entrypoint cat alpine /etc/os-release
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
## Print the users present in the Alpine container
Can you make the Alpine container print the contents of the /etc/passwd file? (which contains details of the registered users of a Linux system)

::::::::::::::::::::::: solution
```bash
$ docker run --entrypoint cat alpine /etc/passwd
```
or
```bash
$ docker run alpine cat /etc/passwd
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can see from the output that we are indeed running in an Alpine container and now have a powerful way to execute single commands in a Docker container.


## Running a container interactively

But what if we wanted to run a series of commands? What if we wanted to be able to explore within a container?

We will look now at how we can create interactive sessions for using Docker containers.

Luckily this is straightforward, we simply need to modify our standard Docker command to include two new flags.

We need to add:

- '-i' to enable interactivity
- '-t' to enable a TTY connection (the ability to type things!)

Let's try this with the Alpine image:
```bash
$ docker run -i -t alpine
```
```output
/ #
```

You are now inside the container! Let's try some familiar commands.
```bash
/# cat /etc/os-release
```
```output
NAME="Alpine Linux"
ID=alpine
VERSION\_ID=3.17.3
PRETTY\_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.17"
HOME\_URL="[https://alpinelinux.org/](https://alpinelinux.org/)"
BUG\_REPORT\_URL="[https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues)"
```

You can see we get the same output as earlier, but this time the container remains live and we remain inside the container.

You can now exit the container by running:
```bash
/# exit
```

Using containers in this interactive way can be useful, but we have to be careful as (by default) our changes will not persist.

You can see this for yourself with the following process
```bash
$ docker run -i -t alpine
/# touch hello-world
/# echo "hi everyone" > hello-world
/# cat hello-world
/# exit
```
```output
> hi everyone
```
```bash
$ docker run -i -t alpine
/# cat hello-world
```
```output
> cat: can't open 'hello-world': No such file or directory
```

You can see that, while we were still interacting with the container, our file continued to exist. Once we left, it was gone!


## Getting files into the container

Now that we are figuring out how to work with containers, let's imagine a situation.
We are working in a data science lab, and our supervisor has asked us to run some tools that they have developed;
which they are distributing in Docker.

The first tool, called Random, generates a series of random numbers.
The second tool, named Datamash, performs simple statistical analyses on single columns of data.
Let's figure out how to use these tools and some of the hurdles we will have to overcome.

First, let's download the tools:
```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/uomresearchit/random
$ docker pull ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash
```

Great! But... how can we check what has happened? How can we know we have the images? Let's check with:
```bash
$ docker image ls
```
```output
REPOSITORY                                       TAG                            IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash                   latest                         a0143c45d868   5 minutes ago   49.7MB
ghcr.io/uomresearchit/random                     latest                         b39bc463abfd   6 weeks ago     7.04MB
```

You should see output similar to the above, with the images we just pulled listed.

Now we have the tools let's try running them. We'll start by generating our data:
```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/uomresearchit/random
```
```output
[...]
[Lot's of numbers!]
[...]
22307
21278
28211
21151
9209
```

We can see this produces a **lot** of output. Let's write it to file instead:
```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/uomresearchit/random > local\_data.txt
```

We now have a datafile we can use on our other tool.
Our supervisor has told us a couple of helpful things about this container,
apparently all you have to do is give the container the filename you want to analyse.

Let's try that!
```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash local\_data.txt
```
```output
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "//mean.py", line 7, in <module>
with open(args.filename) as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'local\_data.txt'
```

We gave the right filename... So why hasn't this worked? The answer is simple, but has profound implications.

The file we specified is present on our machine, but not inside the container! The container has its own, completely isolated filesystem.

This can really help, the container's file are stored in a nice, safe, isolated place perfectly tailored for the application.
But then, how can we give our file to the container, in order for it to be analysed?


## Using mounts and volumes

Docker's answer to this is to allow you to selectively expose files and folders on your machine to the container you are running.

Docker calls these bind mounts and they take the following form:
![](fig/docker_mount.png){alt='A breakdown of the command for mounting a file into a container.'}

Using this command we specify the type of mount we want (more on this later!),
the name of a local file (or directory) to mount to the container and the path and filename which we would like inside the container.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
### $PWD
You will notice we used an envirnoment variable (denoted by $) to specify the location of our local file.
This is because the docker command needs the full path to a file to mount correctly, it wont work if you do `./local_file.txt`!
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's try this out with our datamash container:
```bash
$ docker run --mount type=bind,source="$PWD"/local\_data.txt,target=/local\_data.txt ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash local\_data.txt
```
```output
Data file data.txt, selected.
Number of entries: 100.0
Sum: 1681522.0
Mean: 16815.22
```

Wonderful! The container works now. But that syntax is very clunky... Can it be shortened? The answer is yes, but it requires care - let's investigate.

Try out the following command:
```bash
$ docker run -v $PWD/data.txt:/data.txt ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash data.txt
```

It works just like before! But there is a hidden danger here.

So far we have only discussed bind mounts. These are a simple mechanism for binding bits of your local filesystem into containers.
There is another method for getting files into container, called volumes.

Volumes are the isolated, persistent filesystems for containers,
they can be shared between containers and are very useful for retaining information between container runs.

However, they are not particularly useful for getting files from host to container!

Can you spot the difference?
```bash
$ docker run -v data.txt:/data.txt ghcr.io/uomresearchit/datamash data.txt
```
```output
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "//mean.py", line 7, in <module>
with open(args.filename) as f:
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: 'data.txt'
```

Why has this not worked? The answer is that Docker has created a volume! Not mounted our file!
This is because the Docker command requires absolute paths, if a path doesn't evaluate correclty then it assumes you are naming a new volume.

See this bit of the Docker man page:
```
\-v|--volume[\=[[HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]]
Create a bind mount. If you specify, -v /HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR, Docker
bind mounts /HOST-DIR in the host to /CONTAINER-DIR in the Docker
container. If 'HOST-DIR' is omitted,  Docker automatically creates the new
volume on the host.
```

For this reason, we would recommend using the full (clunky) syntax of the mount command.
